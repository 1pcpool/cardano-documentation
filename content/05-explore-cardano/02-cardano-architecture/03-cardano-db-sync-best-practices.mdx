This section outlines some best practices for using the Cardano DB Sync component.

### Purpose of Cardano DB Sync

The purpose of Cardano DB Sync is to follow the Cardano chain and fetch information, including the ledger state, from the chain.  
The Cardano DB Sync component works best with a Cardano node running on the local machine.  
DB Sync uses the data extracted from the chain to build tables in a PostgreSQL database.  
You can then run SQL queries against the database schema as queries embedded in any language that has libraries for interacting with an SQL database.  
Besides running SQL queries from a program, you can interact with the database engine via the command line using [the psql executable](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) that comes with PostgreSQL. With psql, you can execute queries directly, and access metadata such as the names of all the tables in the database (/d command) and the columns each table contains.

Here are some examples of what you can do with a Cardano DB Sync instance on a
specific network:

- Retrieve details of any block, transaction, address, or stake pool on that network, usually by the hash that identifies that item or the index into another table.
- Get the balance of any stake address for a specific epoch.
- Check the amount of ada that is delegated to each stake pool for a specific epoch.


For details of sample queries, see
[Sample Cardano DB Sync queries](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/interesting-queries.md).

**Recommended Hardware for Cardano DB Sync**

We recommend the following hardware for Cardano DB Sync (with both DB Sync and
the node running on the same machine):

- A Linux distribution (for example, Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, Arch)
- 8 Gigabytes of RAM
- 2 CPU cores
- 50 Gigabytes or more of disk storage. The Cardano team recommends using SSD for performance. 
> The disk storage given is for DB Sync. You will need additional storage for synchronization with the blockchain.  

The recommended configuration is to have the DB Sync and the PostgreSQL server on the same machine. During syncing (when retrieving historical data from the blockchain), there is a massive amount of data traffic between DB Sync and the database. Traffic to a local database is significantly faster than traffic to a database on the local area network (LAN) or remotely to another location.

To run Cardano DB Sync, you first need to run a full Cardano node.  
For more information, see the [building and running instructions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/building-running.md).

**Sample Cardano DB Sync queries**

We have compiled a list of [sample SQL queries](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/interesting-queries.md) that you can run against the DB Sync database.

You can run these queries using psql. You can connect to the database from the Cardano DB Sync git checkout using:

```
PGPASSFILE=config/pgpass-mainnet psql cexplorer
```

You can also find the sample queries in the next section (Working with Cardano DB Sync).
